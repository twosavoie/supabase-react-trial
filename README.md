# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Built using the Supabase Web App Demo [Build a User Management App with React](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/tutorials/with-react)

To run:
`npm run dev`

Thanks so much to these awesome folks:

[Coding in Public YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwHJMlvZRCc) was amazing. Very little modification was needed to create two modals.

[Krina Sardhara's blog post (at DhiWise)](https://www.dhiwise.com/post/solution-for-children-is-missing-in-props-validation-in) did an excellent job explaining the props validation error.
